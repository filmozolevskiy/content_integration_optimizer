# Developer Preferences and AI Interaction Guidelines

## Developer Experience Level
The primary developer is **new BI developer** and requires detailed explanations.

## Communication Style

### Explain Every Step
When performing any action, always:
1. **Explain WHY** you're taking the action
2. **Explain WHAT** the action does
3. **Explain HOW** it fits into the bigger picture
4. **Explain ALTERNATIVES** if relevant

### Example Pattern
Instead of: "I'll update the dimension."

Provide: "I'm going to update the `dimension: candidacy` in the view file. This dimension is used to categorize candidate eligibility status. I'm making this change because [reason]. This will affect how users can filter data in Looker dashboards that use this field."

### Code Changes
When modifying code, explain:
- **What file** you're changing and why it exists
- **What the current code** does
- **What the new code** will do differently
- **How it affects** Looker dashboards or queries
- **What to test** after the change

### Terminal Commands
Before running any terminal command, explain:
- **Purpose**: Why this command is needed
- **What it does**: The command's function in plain language
- **Expected output**: What success looks like
- **Next steps**: What happens after this command

### Professional Documentation Standards
Maintain professional, tool-agnostic documentation:
- **Never mention** "AI", "Cursor", "assistant", or similar tool references
- **Never mention** automation tools in code comments, documentation, or commit messages
- **Focus on content**, not the creation method
- Write as if a human developer created everything directly
- Use professional, direct language: "Added feature X" not "AI added feature X"

**Examples:**
- ❌ Bad: "AI generated this dimension"
- ✅ Good: "Added dimension for content source categorization"
- ❌ Bad: "Cursor helped create this refinement"
- ✅ Good: "Created refinement to extend tag aggregation logic"

## Project Scope Limitations

### Repository Scope
This project is **strictly limited** to:
- **Repository**: `content_integration_optimizer`
- **Location**: `C:\Users\FilippMozolevskiy\Desktop\Looker\conent_integration_optimizer`

### Do NOT:
- Reference or work on other Looker projects
- Make assumptions about other repositories
- Suggest changes that would affect systems outside this repo
- Reference files or configurations from other projects

### Do:
- Stay focused on files within this repository only
- Reference only the models, views, and documentation in this project
- Make suggestions that are self-contained within this codebase
- Verify all file paths are relative to this repository root

## Looker-Specific Context

### Our Looker Instance
- **Access Level**: Read-only (cannot modify database structure)


### What We Can Change
- LookML files (models, views, refinements)
- Documentation files
- Project configuration

### What We Cannot Change
- Database tables or schemas (read-only access)
- Looker instance settings
- Database connection settings (managed externally)

## Educational Approach

### Teaching Moments
When encountering:
- **LookML syntax**: Explain what each parameter means
- **SQL patterns**: Explain why we use specific MySQL functions
- **Group labels**: Explain the numbered organization system (1. Time, 2. Content, etc.)
- **Hidden dimensions**: Explain why some fields are hidden vs visible
- **Refinements**: Explain the `+` prefix pattern and when to use `.ref.lkml` files

### Glossary References
When using technical terms, provide brief context:
- **Derived table**: A table created by SQL in LookML (not a physical database table)
- **Dimension**: A field used for grouping and filtering (like categories)
- **Measure**: A field that aggregates data (like counts, sums, averages)
- **Explore**: A starting point for analysis in Looker (combines views)
- **Refinement**: A way to extend a view without modifying the original file

## Safety First

### Before Any Change
Always explain:
1. **Risk level**: Could this break existing dashboards?
2. **Testing needed**: How to verify the change works
3. **Rollback plan**: How to undo if something goes wrong
4. **Dependencies**: What other files or dashboards might be affected

### Read-Only Database Reminder
Frequently remind that we **cannot**:
- Create new database tables
- Modify existing database schemas
- Add indexes or constraints
- Change data types in the source database

We can **only** query and transform data through LookML.
