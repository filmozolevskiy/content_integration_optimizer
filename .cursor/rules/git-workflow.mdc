# Git Workflow and Standards

## Branch Naming
Use descriptive feature branch names with prefixes:
- `feature/` - for new features
- `fix/` - for bug fixes
- `docs/` - for documentation updates
- `refactor/` - for code refactoring

Example: `feature/code-review-improvements`

## Commit Messages
Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- Any breaking changes or dependencies

### Professional Commit Standards
**NEVER mention:**
- "AI", "Cursor", "assistant", or automation tools
- The method or tool used to create the changes
- References to code generation or assistance

**Write commits as direct developer actions:**
- ✅ Good: "Add tag aggregation dimension with exception handling"
- ✅ Good: "Refactor tag grouping logic in derived table"
- ✅ Good: "Update group labels for better organization"
- ✅ Good: "Add measure for counting distinct contestants"
- ❌ Bad: "AI generated tag dimension"
- ❌ Bad: "Cursor added error handling"
- ❌ Bad: "Used assistant to update labels"

**Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW it was created**

## File Change Review
Before committing changes:
1. Review all modified files with `git status`
2. Use `git diff` to review specific changes
3. Stage files intentionally with `git add`
4. Ensure all changes align with the intended feature/fix

## Working with LookML Files
- Test changes in Looker before committing
- Validate SQL syntax for derived tables
- Ensure field references are correct
- Check that explores load without errors

## Pre-Commit Checklist
- [ ] All LookML syntax is valid
- [ ] No hardcoded values that should be parameters
- [ ] Group labels and organization are consistent
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] Code review document created (if applicable)
- [ ] Commit message contains no references to AI, Cursor, or automation tools
- [ ] Code comments are professional and tool-agnostic
